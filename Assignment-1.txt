/* We have to create tables which corresponds to the following schema :
employee(employee-name,street,city,email-id)
works(employee-name,company-name,salary)
company(company-name,city)
manages(employee-name,manager-name)
*/

--The solutions to above are as follows :
1 )
CREATE TABLE employee (
  employeeName varchar(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  street varchar(30),
  city varchar(30),
  emailID varchar(30)
  );
  
2 )
CREATE TABLE works (
	employeeName varchar(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	companyName varchar(30) UNIQUE,
	salary varchar(10),
	FOREIGN KEY (employeeName) REFERENCES employee(employeeName)
);

3)
CREATE TABLE company (
	companyName varchar(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	city varchar(30),
	FOREIGN KEY (companyName) REFERENCES works(companyName)
);

4)
CREATE TABLE manages (
	employeeName varchar(30) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	managerName varchar(30),
	FOREIGN KEY (employeename) REFERENCES employee(employeeName)
);
