--Following are the queries for creating the tables

1.
CREATE TABLE Flights(
flno number(4) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
fromLocation varchar(15),
toLocation varchar(15), 
distance number(5), 
departs time,
arrives time,
price number(10)
);

2.
CREATE TABLE Aircraft(
aid number(4) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
aname varchar(20),
cruisingRange number(5)
);

3.
CREATE TABLE Certified(
eid number(4),
aid number(4)
CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (eid, aid),
FOREIGN KEY (eid) REFERENCES Employees(eid),
FOREIGN KEY (aid) REFERENCES Aircraft(aid)
);

4.
CREATE TABLE Employees(
eid number(4) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
ename varchar(30),
salary number(5)
)

--The SQL queries are as follows:
a.
SELECT aname 
FROM Aircraft
INNER JOIN Certified ON Aircraft.aid = Certified.aid
INNER JOIN Employess ON Certified.eid = Employees.eid
WHERE Employees.salary>80000;

b.
SELECT certified.eid, max(aircraft.cruisingRange)
FROM Certified
INNER JOIN aircraft ON certified.aid = aircraft.aid
WHERE eid IN (SELECT eid FROM certified GROUP BY eid HAVING COUNT(*)>=3)
GROUP BY eid;

c.
SELECT ename
FROM Employee
WHERE salary<(SELECT min(price) FROM Flights WHERE fromLocation='Los Angeles' AND toLocation='Honolulu')
AND eid in (SELECT eid FROM Certified);

d.
SELECT aircraft.aname AS 'Aircraft Name', FORMAT(avg(employees.salary), '99999.99') AS 'Avg Salary'
FROM Aircraft
INNER JOIN Certified ON Aircraft.aid = Certified.aid
INNER JOIN Employees ON Certified.eid = Employees.eid
WHERE Aircraft.cruisingRange>1000
GROUP BY aircraft.aid, aircraft.aname

e.
SELECT DISTINCT Employees.ename
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Certified ON Employees.eid = Certified.eid
INNER JOIN Aircraft ON Certified.aid = Aircraft.aid
WHERE Aircraft.aname='Boeing'

f.
SELECT aid 
FROM Aircraft
WHERE cruisingRange>(SELECT distance FROM FLights WHERE fromLocation='Los Angeles' AND toLocation='Chicago')

g.
SELECT fromLocation AS 'From', toLocation AS 'To'
FROM Flights
WHERE distance<=(SELECT max(Aircraft.cruisingRange)
FROM Aircraft
INNER JOIN Certified ON Aircraft.aid = Certified.aid
INNER JOIN Employees ON Certified.eid = Employees.eid
WHERE Employees.salary>=100000)

h.
SELECT Employees.ename 
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Certified ON Employees.eid = Certified.eid
INNER JOIN Aircraft ON Certified.aid = Aircraft.aid
WHERE Aircraft.cruisingRange>3000

i.
--Weird question

j.
SELECT avg(salary)-(SELECT avg(salary) FROM Employees WHERE eid IN (SELECT eid FROM Certified)) AS 'Salary Difference' FROM Employees
--Cant get the format function to work in here

h.
SELECT ename, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE eid NOT IN (SELECT eid FROM Certified) AND salary>(SELECT avg(salary) FROM Employees INNER JOIN Certified ON Employees.eid = Certified.eid)
